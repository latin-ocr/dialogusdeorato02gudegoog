168 enimcum urrunnun

The reading of AB violatas the ‘collocatio uerborum' oi Tacitus, who
does not allow two attributes to be separated by the word which they
modify.

31,19, et promptius] prooiptius- MSS.

31, 10. <ad dicendum) materia] od dicendum oratorio-MSS.

32,12. otoyaoe quidem . . . quonium (quidem) eoo. Iam in-
clined to regard this transferente of quidem advocated in orit. note,
p. 313, as certain.

35, 2. plus. As three elements are enumerated, the Latin idiom
would seem to call ior plurimum.

36, 22. calescit] clarescit. I now feel that the easy change
formerly suggested is not absolutely necessary.

36,18. qul quin] quio—MSS.

37, 27. aut] Well·autl1entioated iustanoes of a plural verb with
ant are so extremely rare (see note ool loo.) that I feel convinced that
et is the only admissible reading. The confusion between ‘et' and
‘aut' is notoriously common.

37, 9. extollant] mirentur-John, lo.

38, ll. † extiterint] existit, which seems preferable here to estitit

(Bennett).

40, 4. i ut histriones] (et histrioiies>.—This reading oi all the
MSS. is clearly the gloss ol some reader who did not know that the
ὀνομαστὶ κωμῳδεῖν was never permitted in Rome. This obiection
applies to the reading ut histriones as well. See crit. note, p. 367.

41, 22. ac (vestra) tempore] vitos uestros oc temporo—Bekker.

The following readings in the text oi the editio molor were due to
errors:

21‚17. Atti] Arri.

21, 32. illae] reliquae.

26, 28. frequens, sicuti hle . . . clam . . . et] frequens
(siem bis] exclamatio. In the deletion of sicut his Ι follow L. Duvau,
Rev. cle phil. XXI. (1897) p. 129.

26, 15. etin publicum] io piiblicom.

30, 8, . . . referem] . . . stotimroseram.
