rigidly employed than it is, Tacitus, on the one hand,
had every reason to represent himself sufficiently young
to render his presence at the debate as a passive listener
dramatically plausible3 on the other hand, it must not be
forgotten that in men of genius seven years work a grem
change, and we happen to know that Tacitus, as early as the
reign of Titus, had already attained the quaestorship and
won an enduring reputation as an orator, and in ll uu, at
the age of 22, had become betrothed to the daughter of
Agricola, who was just on the point of departing for Britain,
the scene of his great triumphs soon after. Itis entirely
reasonable that a man who had acquired such distinction at
so early an age was not only intellectually sufficiently mature
to grapple with the question discussed in our treatise, but
that he might also have felt, looking back over seven eventful
years, that he was still a ‘very young man' at the time when
he was still serving his oratorical apprenticeship under Aper
and Secundus. The use of the term iuueuls admodum must,
therefore, be regarded as quite unobjectionable, and is there·
fore no obstacle to the assumptiones an early date for the
Dialogus.2

That Vibius Crispus was highly influential under Domi-
tian is true, but like all informers he was iu all probability
in disgrace under Titus.

Regarding the interlocutors there can be no possible doubt
that they were no longer living when the Dialogus was
written, and they may, for aught we know to the contrary,

have died before 81 A.1>.³
That the difference in style between the Dialogus and the
