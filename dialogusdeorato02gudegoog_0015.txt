reign of Titus (79-81) a youth οἱ 24—265 but Tacitus, it is
argued, cannot have written the Dialoyu« st this period,
because so profouud s. problem ss the decline of eloquenee
would not have suggested itself to so young s. insu. Not
is it ursdible that he would have dosignatsd himself ss
having been iuvenis admodum only seven years previous.

Aguin, it was said not to bs probable that the Dialoym
wu oomposed while any oi the interlocutum were yet
living, m· while Eprius Marcellus und Vibius Crispus, so
severely criticised by the author, were still in power; but
Crispus died in 93 Am„ highly honored by Domitian, and
Maternus, ss has rsesutly again been asserted, must bs
identified with the sophist of that name executed under
Domitian, in 91 Am. Nor eun the Dialogus bs assigned to
the few remaining years of that emperor, because Tseitus
tells us expressly that ho wrote nothing throughout the long
reign of Domitian (Sl-96).

But if the perimi undet Titus eud Domitian is out of the
question, so likewise, it is contendes, ere the years imme-
diately following, because the publication of the Dialogus
would then have been eoutempomneous with that of the
Ayricula sud Germania (98 eam), aud this would involve tho
psychological improbability that the same writer coum si-
multaneously employ two kinds oi* style, admittedly sn sif-
ferent as that of the Dialoqus on the une hand sud that of
ths Ayw-icola and Germania on the other. Our treatise, it
is therefore argued, cannot he a genuine work of Taeitus,

objections refutem—But this apparently nogent argumen-
tation is demonstrably fullaeious.
