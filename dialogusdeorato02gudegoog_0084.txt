All the interlocutors addueed plausible reasons to show that a great
change had coine over oratory‚ but they were nat equally unanimous
in characterizing it as a decline, for there mas also one present mbo

22. eloquentiam. . . ingeniis: this dces not signiiy that the
eloquence 01 the moderna, on the one hand, was contrasted with the
genius oi the ancients on the other, but the intellectual achievements
oi both periods in the field oi cratory are mutually compared. The
slightly illogical antithesm was occasioned by that desire ior formal
synnnetry 00 characteristic nithe style oi this treatise. Cp. ch. 31,

strong intluence which Cicero still exercised over the youthful author.

dealing with the reoliile letzem 01 Cato the Younger, who committed ’

suicide at Utica (Africa) in tt nc. This sturdy opponent oi Caesar
was extravagantly praised in the early empire by poets and rhetori-
