That σίων-οἰ writiugs, particularly the rhetorical werke,
constituted the chief source, w-ill be apparent from the fore-
going renim-ke, eud is abundantly illuetreted iu the Notae.

A minor source of information is found in the compile-
tinus of Mucianus, entitled Acta and Epistulae, expreesly
oited in eh. 37, 6. To them Tacitus owee many details eon-
oerning the oratore oi the Republie net given iu Cieero's
Brutus, as eg. the feet that they delivered no speeehes
before the aentumviral eourts (see note ch. 38, 23), the re-
spective agee of Cra-esus, Caesar, Pollio, aud Calvus et the
time they made their oratoriae] debut, etul the names of the
defendente on these once-sione. The chronological errore iu-
volved (see notes ch⁴ 24, 21 ff) in themselves suggest a
later, postrAugustau origin, aud that the Λαιι of Mucianus
were any more trustworthy guides then some uf hie treetises
eonsulted by the elder Pliny, we have no reason to believe.
The Epistulae probably furnislied the material for the state
ments made coueerning the wax-fare between Cicero and his
oratorieal rivale. The original nox-respondeum between
thern was uo longer easily amessible iu the reign of Vespa,-
sian (nh. 37, ΜΔ), aud a number of striking parallelisms in
Quintilian aud Plutarch seem te justify the infereuee thet
they too took their informationi on the subject at second-haud
from the sal-ne convenient eulleetion⁴ Cp. nutes nh. 18, ΗΕ.
