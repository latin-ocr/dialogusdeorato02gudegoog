as evidenned by many parallel panea-gen in his labet writiugs.

In his fondness, finally, for crystallizing ethical reflant-iona
or general truths in pointed epigram and ‹msefully balanced
antithesis, the author of the Dialoqma clearly reveals-——ez
unque lenum —the penetrating observer and cha master of
epigram, so well known to us from the hiemrical writings of
Tacitus.

The Dialoyzm was wrikten by a man possessed of an ex-
tensive knowledge of the chanami-istius of Roman eloquenee
and its history. That the hiemi-iau Tacitus was equally
qunlified for euch work is, aa we have seen, noe only estab-
lished by the oratorium reputation which he had won, but is
abundantly evidenb froin his writiugs which display a per-
fect mastery ovet all the resources of lauguuge. But what
is still more pertinent to the present iuquiry, he never loses
an opportunity of characterizing the ommi-mal efforts of in-
dividuale, aud where, as happens frequently to be the case, ¹
we ean still compare the judgment passed upon luen who
are also mentioued by the author of Dialoyus, we again find
every prunouueed similarity, it being also a feature peculiar
ω both writers, that their prejudices against the moral con-

to hie iutellentual ahilities⁴
