Chrysippus. —Finally, it can be shown that the remarks
on the education of children (ch. 28 f.) are not wholly origi-
nal with the youthful author, but have been largely influ-
enced, directly or indirectly, by an exhaustive and popular
treatise on this subject by the celebrated Stoio Chrysippus
which bore the title περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς. Quintilian, who

quotes from this work repeatedly, PseudoPlutarch's περὶ ·

umber ἀγωγῆς, and the Dialogus coincide so frequently, even
in the phraseology, as pointed out in the Notos, that the
conclusion of their common indebtedness to the Stoic's trea
tiso—for they are independent of one another-becomes
irresistible.l

But, however extensive the obligations of the author to
previous writers, notably Cicero, may have been, we cannot
butconoede that Tacitus, even in this treatise of his youth,
was no slavish imitator, but that he assimilated his horrowed
material in so thorough a manner, as to make it virtually
his own, thus succeeding in producing abrilliant work, Ι
dramatis in construction, artistically elaborated in style and
substance, and, in consequence, bearing all the outward in-
dications oi an original composition.
