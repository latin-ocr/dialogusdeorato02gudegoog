Pharroa.

Tms edition of the Dialogus was prepared at the request
of the Editors-inchief and others who desired the material
collected in my larger work¹ to be made available for the
use of college students. The proposal was the more readily
accepted, as it gave me the welcorne opportunity of availing
myself of the reviews called forth by the editio accior, as
well as oi special exegetica] or critical contributions that
had come to my notice since its appearance. While the
present work remains essentially an epitome, those scholars
who may condescend to peruse it will, neverthelesS, find ¹
that it has been very carefully revised throughout, that
views if erroneous, have been abandoned, others stated
with greater precision, and not a little that is new has
been added. I have, 'even more persistently than for-
merly, aimed at making Tacitus his own interpreter, a
method preeminently effective in dispelling, by the cumu-
lative evidence of concrete parallelisms of thought and dic·
tion, all doubt as to the Tacitean authorship of the treatise.
-The necessarily brief discussion of this controversy in the
Introduction will, Ι hope, prove adequate to the purpose
of this book. The recent contributions to this subject, viz,
those made by Steelc, Dienel, Hirzel, Leo, and Norden, have
